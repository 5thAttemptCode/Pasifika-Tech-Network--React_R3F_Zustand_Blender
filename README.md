!important! I was not asked to do a redesign or rebuild of the original website. This is a personal project only. Content is taken from the orignal website.

# PROJECT: Pasifika Tech Network
LIVE DEMO: https://ptn.netlify.app/  

# TECHSTACK: React, React-Three-Fiber, React-Three/PostProcessing, Blender, Zustand  

# About 
This project is a redesign/rebuild. It is build with React. The landing page has a canvas component build with React-Three-Fiber. The gltf model is build with Blender and the textures are baked. Since the topic of this project is personal to me as well, the model represents an important element from Oceania Pacific region, which I combined with the topic of this website (the polynesian fish hook centered on the CPU motherboard). Also the words "Pacifica CORE" should underline the deeper meaning of this model and project. The model for now is alright, but currently Im working on an idea with a new model including shaders. The goal is to not just have a model floating around in the background, but rather create a hypnotizing experience. For the neon-glow effect I used React-Three/PostProcessing. For state management I used Zustand, however it needs a tiny adjustment which I still need to figure out. 

#CONCLUSION
The original is build with Docusaurus, and after learning by the owner why Docusaurus was chosen, it became clear to me that my chosen tech-stack is not the most optimal solution. However It was a great learning experience, and working on real-life projects is always much more fun.
